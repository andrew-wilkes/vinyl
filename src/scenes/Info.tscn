You need to import (link-to) .mp3 or .ogg music files on your computer.
This is done in the Music Tracks scene.
The imported tracks are then listed.
The music files are not moved or deleted, just referenced.
Once the tracks have been added to  a record, they can be removed from the track list.

[b]Creating a record[/b]
This is done in the Record Producer scene.

Select tracks to add to side A and side B of a new record. Press the + buttons.
Set the values for the record size and speed.
The utilization indicator shows how the tracks might fit or not fit onto a physical vinyl disc.
Even an impractical set of tracks will still be sqeezed into the simulated record play area.

New records will be added to the list of albums that may be selected and appear in the music cabinet.

You can create artwork or click on the label and sleeve icons to select image files to use.

An album at least needs a Title in order to be saved when closing the app.

[b]Creating artwork[/b]

Create sleeve and label art in the Artwork scene.

This is applied to the currently selected album.

The created images need to be saved to disc for them to be applied.
Other external saved images may also be used for labels and sleeves (see above).
Set the background color of the front cover to change the sleeve edge color.

[b]Selecting an album to play[/b]

This can be selected from the Music Library shelf or from a drop down list in the Record Producer or Artwork scenes.

[b]Playing an album[/b]

After selecting an album, it appears in the Record Player scene and may be loaded onto the platter.

Set the speed and carefully place the needle onto the disc to play. Use the lever to raise or lower the tone arm.

The tone arm needs to be clear of the platter area in order to load or eject a record.
